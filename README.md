# stack-trace-test

An example of parsing a stack trace in JavaScript using [StackTrace.js](https://www.stacktracejs.com/#!/docs/error-stack-parser).

This example is broken and [I've logged an issue with StackTrace.js](https://github.com/stacktracejs/error-stack-parser/issues/45).

If you are having trouble with StackTrace.js (it has problems and many unresolved issues) I recommend that you try [stacktrace-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stacktrace-parser). It's simple and it works. [Please see my example of using it](https://github.com/ashleydavis/javascript-stack-trace-parsing-example).
